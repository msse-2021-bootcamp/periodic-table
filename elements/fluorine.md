Fluorine is a member of the halogens with the atomic number 9 and symbol F. It exists at standard conditions as a highly toxic, pale yellow gas and is extremely reactive due to being the most electronegative element. 

Commercially it is used in many solvents and high-temperature plastics such as Teflon. In animals its ion, fluoride, is essential for strengthening teeth and bones. Many countries include fluoride as part of their drinking water (less than 2 ppm) to prevent dental cavities.
